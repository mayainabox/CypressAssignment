# Cypress Assignment

This repository contains code and files for a Cypress assignment. Here's an overview of what you'll find:

## App Folder

The `app` folder contains PDF files used for the first assignment.

## Cypress Folder

The `cypress` folder is organized into two main subfolders:

### E2E Folder

Inside the `e2e` folder, you will find Cypress test files (`*.cy` files) related to the assignments.

### Scripts Folder

Inside the `scripts` folder, you'll find a TypeScript file named `readPdf.ts`. This file:

- Imports essential libraries (`fs`, `path`, `pdf-parse`) for PDF handling.
- Defines a `readPdf` function, which is used to read and parse a PDF file.
- Returns the text content of the PDF as a Promise.
